# This module, written in K&R Sunder, will not compile with the standard Sunder
# compiler! Thankfully, the module is tagged with "pdp11", so sunder-compile
# will skip this module when the "import-platform-specific" directory is
# imported, as "pdp11" does not match the arch or host tags for any of the
# platforms supported by Sunder.
